# THE LAWS OF LIFE

## Why's?

- Why are some people and organizations more successful than others?
- Why do some people have wonderful careers, moving from position to position, onward and upward, earning far more money, being consistently paid more and promoted faster?
- Why is it that others go from job to job, continually worrying about money and feeling that they are unappreciated for their hard work and their contributions?
- Why do so many people, as Thoreau once wrote, “live lives of quiet desperation?”

## Let's Discuss

- When I started my business career, I was so far behind, I thought I was first.
- I moved from job to job, seldom by choice, a bit bewildered by the swirl of events around me and my bosses' seemingly unreasonable and unpredictable behaviours.
- I felt like a pawn, playing in a game, or being played in a game, in which I didn’t clearly understand the rules.
- Then I began asking, “Why are some people more successful than others?”
- I noticed that the people around me who were doing better than me did not seem to be smarter than me or of better character.
- Sometimes, they had difficult personalities and questionable ethics.
- Often their ideas and opinions didn’t make much sense. But they were doing well nonetheless.

### The Great Discovery

- The first big breakthrough for me was my discovery of the `Aristotelian Principle of Causality`, what we today call the `Law of Cause and Effect`.
- At a time when most people believed in Gods on Mount Olympus who amused themselves by toying with human fate and destiny, Aristotle stated something completely different.
- It changed our view of the world forever.
